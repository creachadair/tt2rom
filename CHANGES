History of Revisions for 'tt2rom', version 2.x

Rev# Date        Who
---- ----------- ---
2.08 02-Feb-2013 mjf ---------------------------------------------------

	Cleaned up a couple of compiler warnings about format strings, and got
	rid of some weird indentation and whitespace cruft, as well as the old
	and somewhat clunky folding-mode marks.  No functional changes.

2.07 22-Apr-2002 mjf ---------------------------------------------------

	Primarily cosmetic changes, correcting a few clumsy things in the code,
	and redirecting mail queries to the Thayer admin list instead of me
	personally (since I won't be around forever).

2.06 08-Jun-2001 mjf ---------------------------------------------------

	Modified handling of output file names.  Now, output filenames are
	generated by taking the first (up to) 6 characters of the input file
	name, adding a number and '.hex', e.g.:

		foo.txt ==> foo0.hex, foo1.hex, etc.

	If the input file name has an empty prefix, the names default to the
	format 'output0.hex'.  Also, you can still override this by setting the
	FTEMPLATE environment variable (if you do this, the new behaviour
	described above is ignored).

2.05 13-Nov-2000 mjf ---------------------------------------------------

	Corrected a potential buffer overflow in parse_option(), one of the
	utility routines defined in text.c.  Option names and values which
	exceed a particular limit are truncated (this limit may be changed at
	compile time by modifying OPTBUF_SIZE in text.c).

2.04 12-Oct-2000 mjf ---------------------------------------------------

	Added checks for the value of FTEMPLATE, if provided, to make sure it
	does not open up a format string vulnerability.  Cleaned up a few
	compiler warnings in the <ctype.h> functions by adding casts of char
	types to int.  No new functionality.

2.03 28-May-1999 mjf ---------------------------------------------------

	Fixes a bug in offset record checksums; the checksum was not accounting
	for the record size.  Default output file name is now 'sourceX.hex'
	instead of 'romX.img', and this can be changed by setting the
	"FTEMPLATE" environment variable (the name template should contain a
	'%d' to indicate where the number is to go)

2.02 21-May-1999 mjf ---------------------------------------------------

	Now prints out a version banner each time it runs, so that conflicting
	versions can be quickly identified (people seem to keep old versions
	around a lot, for some reason)

2.01 07-May-1999 mjf ---------------------------------------------------

	Fixed a bug which would cause the program to crash if given an input
	file without a configuration line.

2.00 03-May-1999 mjf ---------------------------------------------------

	First release version built for Windows NT.
